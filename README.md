# Full Stack AI Mock Interview App with Next.js

Welcome to the Full Stack AI Mock Interview App! In this project, I have built and deployed a powerful AI-driven mock interview application using cutting-edge technologies like React, Drizzle ORM, Gemini AI, and Clerk.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application provides a comprehensive platform for conducting AI-powered mock interviews, offering users a realistic and interactive experience. The app is designed to help users prepare effectively for real-world interviews by generating AI-driven questions and recording responses.

## üìö Key Insights

- **Implement Social and Email Password Authentication with Clerk**: Secured the app with Clerk's authentication services.
- **PostgreSQL and Drizzle Setup**: Set up PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless) as the database and configure Drizzle ORM for data management.
- **Generate AI Interview Questions**: Leveraged Gemini Fash 1.5 AI Model to create realistic interview questions.
- **Record User Answer Using Web and Microphone**: Captures user responses via web and microphone inputs. Videos are not recorded or stored.
- **Convert Speech to Text**: Implements speech-to-text conversion for user responses.
- **Record/Save User Response**: Stores user responses securely in the database.
- **Use Generative AI to get feedback and rating**: Present feedback and rating for each interview question answered.
- **Deploy App on Vercel**: Leveraged Vercel to deploy the application on the cloud.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Deployment**: Vercel
